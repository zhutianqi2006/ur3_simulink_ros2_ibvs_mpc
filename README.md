## Environment Required for Simulation Source Code Compilation
The environment used for simulation is Unity 2021.3.22f1

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zhutianqi2006/ur3_unity_ros2_ibvs.git
```
‚ùó‚ùó‚ùóBefore opening the project, make sure Blender is installed on your computer, and it is set as the default program to open .blend files.

Then, open the ur3_unity_ros2_ibvs project.

### Buttons in the Control Panel:

‚≠ê1: Jogging the robot arm, available when disconnected from ros2.

‚≠ê2: ros2 connection button, when clicked, it displays connect and disconnect buttons. Clicking the connect button allows receiving messages from ros2, and vice versa, disconnects the connection.

‚≠ê3: End-effector camera view button, when clicked, the bottom-left corner shows the end-effector camera view with a resolution of 640*480.

### Buttons in the Reset Panel:

Clicking any of these buttons will disconnect from ros2 and reset the positions of the robot arm and objects.

üåü Rest1: Displacement Test üåü Rest2: Large Rotation Test

üåü Rest3: Small Rotation with Displacement üåü Rest4: Large Rotation with Displacement

### Buttons in the Camera View Panel:

üí´ Adjust the viewing angle in Unity

### Keyboard Controls:

Object tracking control
```
Up/Down - Move object forward/backward
Left/Right - Move object left/right
Q/E - Rotate around a vertical axis with respect to the ground
```

### ros2 Communication:

Unity publishes two topics, where /current_pixel publishes the pixel position with data type std_msgs/Float64MultiArray, and /ur3_sim_joint_state publishes joint information, currently only carrying joint positions with data type sensor_msgs/JointState.

The subscribed topic is /simulink_mpc_result, used to obtain joint velocities with data type std_msgs/Float64MultiArray.

### MPC Controller:

This project does not involve the controller part. Controller examples can be found in the Simulink project:
